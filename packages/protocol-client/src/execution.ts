/**
 * Generic, chain-agnostic execution lifecycle shared by Ootle AMM/marketplace routes and

 *
 * Layering contract:
 *   DISCOVER → AUTHORITATIVE REREAD → RESOLVE → CONSTRUCT → SIGN → SUBMIT → PERSIST
 *            → CONFIRM/RECONCILE
 *
 * Invariants:
 *  - Discovery (indexer/search) is advisory; execution decisions require authoritative
 *    chain state read immediately before construction.
 *  - A network timeout must NOT mean "submit again": the operation is persisted as
 *    UNKNOWN and reconciled by durable identifiers (see reconcileUnknownSubmission).
 *  - Skipping the authoritative reread is possible only by passing an explicit
 *    `unsafeAllowStaleConstruction: true` flag; no code path may do it silently.
